					<h2>
						The Process
					</h2>
					<p>
						The process of developing this game began with an idea. First, I came up with a simple idea for a web game. 
						After I had a basic concept figured out, I then began to formulate the main content I would include on my 
						website. Only after I had finished my content did I begin working on the design. Before anything, I began with
						a sketch of what I wanted the site to look like, a template to go off of when actually coding the site. I began 
						building the site with just the page layout in mind. Once I had the page built to the layout I wanted, then I 
						chose to work on the navigation. I have two main sources of navigation on my page. One global navigation system 
						on the top of the page and one local navigation system used exclusively on the proposal page to navigate the 
						sections easier. After finalizing the navigation systems, I then began to choose colors and such to make my page 
						more visually appealing. This was the final step in my process, and once I had established my page's color scheme 
						and design, I was finally finished.
					</p>
					<h2>
						Meeting the Requirements
					</h2>
					<p>
						In order to meet the requirements for this project, I first created my content and submitted it by the beginning of the fourth week 
						of class. For the HTML requirements, I utilized the header and nav tag for the top banner and nav bar on every page. I used footer for
						the copyright on each page. I used section in the proposal page to denote the actual content of the proposal. I used the article tag for 
						the main text on the landing page and for this documentation page. Each page has a title that denotes that the page is about my game 
						Enter the Wormhole and what that specific subpage is about. All of my positioning and formatting were done in an external CSS. In the 
						CSS, I used ID selectors for the proposal page sidebar, the proposal content on the proposal page, the image on the home page, and the 
						screenshots on the proposal page. My class selector was a wrapper class used for resizing the page. All links on my site have been 
						customized and I used no inline styling. My page was created entirely from scratch and is responsive for browsers as small as 480px wide or smaller.
