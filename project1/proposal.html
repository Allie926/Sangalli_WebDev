						but with exciting powerups and movement options provided by the wormholes.

						Enter the Wormhole is a top-down, "twin-sticks shooter" styled shoot-'em-up.

						Story
					</h2>
					<p>
						Life on other planets exists, and they do not come in peace. Planet Earth is under seige by a vicious alien menace with the intent 
						of destroying the planet. Only one person can stop them: You! Tasked with the mission of defense of the Earth, you take flight into 
						the vast unknown to defeat the alien marauders before they can take your home.
					</p>
					<h2 id="aesthetic">
						Aesthetic
					</h2>
					<p>
						Enter the Wormhole is presented in a simple, minimalist cartoonish style. The sound of Enter 
						the Wormhole is reminiscent of old-school 8-bit games. There is a main theme that plays on the 
						title screen and a background theme during the gameplay, both of which are looped. Simple sound 
						effects occur when the player shoots, destroys an enemy, and enters a wormhole.

						Gameplay
					</h2>
					<h3>
						Mechanics
					</h3>
					<p>
						The player has one main goal: destroy the aliens. The player controls the spaceship and must navigate 
						the screen to defeat the aliens coming to destroy the planet. Various wormholes will appear during the 
						game, providing powerups for the player to assist in their defense of the planet, so long as the player 
						can fly into the wormhole. The aliens and wormholes randomly spawn in various locations, meaning no two 
						playthroughs will be the same.
					</p>
					<h3>
						Controls
					</h3>
					<p>
						Enter the Wormhole is controlled exclusively with the keyboard and mouse. Use WASD to control the ship. Move the mouse to control where
						your ship is aiming and click to fire. 
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>W - Up</li>
						<li>A - Left</li>
						<li>S - Down</li>
						<li>D - Right</li>
						<li>Click - Shoot</li>
					</ul>
					<h3>
						How to Play
					</h3>
					<p>
						In order to win, the player must survive the onslaught of aliens. The most important thing to remember is to navigate the ship towards 
						any wormholes that appear. Each wormhole contain a unique powerup for the player. Among these powerups are a laser beam that can shoot 
						through multiple enemies, a missile that explodes upon contact, destroying any aliens who get caught in the blast, a triple shot that 
						allows the player to fire three shots instead of just one, a shield that protects the player for a short time, and a special wormhole 
						that teleports theplayer to another location after a few seconds.
