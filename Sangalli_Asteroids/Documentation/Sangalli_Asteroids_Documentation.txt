Assignment: Asteroids

Description:
This project is a semi-recreation of the Atari game Asteroids. The game is an endless shoot-em-up where you control a spaceship and
try to defend yourself from approaching asteroids.

User Responsibilities:
In this game, the user takes control of the ship and must survive as long as they can against the oncoming asteroids. The player
controls the ship using the arrow keys, using left and right to rotate the ship and the up arrow to accelerate. The player can fire
shots from the ship by pressing the spacebar. The player must dodge and shoot the asteroids approaching the ship in order to survive
as long as possible and achieve a higher score.

Above and Beyond:
For my above and beyond, I implemented a scaling difficulty in the game. As your score increases, the asteroids begin to generate
at a quicker rate. The initial generation rate is once every 3 seconds, or 90 frames. This rate decreases by 15 frames for every 300
points the player earns. I also added a title screen from which there are two buttons to press, Play and Quit. Quit simply quits out of
the application. Play sends you to the actual game. When you get a game over, the ship is destroyed, leaving a Game Over message on
the screen and a Back to Menu button, that brings you back to the title screen.

Notes:
I had a pretty severe spike in my depression this past week in addition to having a lot of work for my other classes and my sorority 
so I'm using my grace period on this project.
