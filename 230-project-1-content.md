Engage on a deep space voyage, take on hostile alien predators
and defend your planet from destruction in Enter the Wormhole. This
Asteroids-like game changes the formula by allowing you to enter wormholes 
to unlock strange new powers and defend your planet from the alien invasion.

#*Proposal*
## 1. Concept
Enter the Wormhole is a top-down space shooter, in the same vain as 
Asteroids, but with exciting powerups and movement options provided by
the wormholes.
## 2. Genre
Enter the Wormhole is a top-down, "twin-sticks shooter" styled shoot-'em-up.
## 3. Platform
This game is currently available only on PC.
## 4. Story
Life on other planets exists, and they do not come in peace. Planet Earth is 
under seige by a vicious alien menace with the intent of destroying the
planet. Only one person can stop them: You! Tasked with the mission of
defense of the Earth, you take flight into the vast unknown to defeat the
alien marauders before they can take your home.
## 5. Aesthetics
Enter the Wormhole is presented in a simple, minimalist cartoonish style. 
The sound of Enter the Wormhole is reminiscent of old-school 8-bit games.
There is a main theme that plays on the title screen and a background theme 
during the gameplay, both of which are looped. Simple sound effects occur
when the player shoots, destroys an enemy, and enters a wormhole.
## 6. Gameplay
### Mechanics
The player has one main goal: destroy the aliens. The player controls the
spaceship and must navigate the screen to defeat the aliens coming to 
destroy the planet. Various wormholes will appear during the game, providing
powerups for the player to assist in their defense of the planet, so long
as the player can fly into the wormhole. The aliens and wormholes randomly
spawn in various locations, meaning no two playthroughs will be the same.
### Control
Enter the Wormhole is controlled exclusively with the keyboard.
*A - Move left
*D - Move right
*W - Move up
*S - Move down
*Spacebar - Shoot
### How to Play
In order to win, the player must survive the onslaught of aliens. The 
most important thing to remember is to navigate the ship towards any
wormholes that appear. Each wormhole contain a unique powerup for the player.
Among these powerups are a laser beam that can shoot through multiple
enemies, a missile that explodes upon contact, destroying any aliens who 
get caught in the blast, a triple shot that allows the player to fire 
three shots instead of just one, a shield that protects the player for a
short time, and a special wormhole that teleports theplayer to another 
location after a few seconds.

#*Documentation*
The process of developing this game began with an idea. First, I came up
with a simple idea for a web game. After I had a basic concept figured out,
I then began making a Markdown file containing all the content I intended 
to have on this website.
